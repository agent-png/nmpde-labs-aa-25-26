- Open input files
    - Use apply otherwise nothing is shown
    - Sopra il box pipeline browser si può scegliere la variabile da visualizzare, scegliere se una componente
      o tutta la magnitude. Si può cambiare la rappresentazione (surface, surface with edges, wireframe, points, volume)
    - Nella barra ancora sopra si possono controllare i timesteps (andare avanti e indietro sono i simbolini come sui lettori cd)
    - Si possono visualizzare più render contemporaneamente e indipendentemente. Con link camera si muovono insieme
    
- Apply filters
    - use ctrl + space to search available filters
    - Again click apply to apply
    - clip -> split on a plane to see different sections of the object
    - slice -> similar to clip but only shows the intersection with the plane
    - cleanToGrid -> removes duplicate points
    - glyph -> show vectors as arrows (play with scaling and stuff to visualize better)
    - streamTracer -> show vector fields as lines (not arrows like before)
    - calculator -> compute a given expression (in each point?) and get a new variable (can also be a vector)
    - computeDerivatives -> computes derivatives...
    - GradientOfUnstructuredDataSet -> similar to computeDerivatives but more complete and can calculate more stuff
    - warpByVector -> move every point in the domain by the vector we specify * a scaling factor
    - warpByScalar -> the same as before but by a scalar. You need to provide a direction in this case
    - AnnotateTime -> mette un time nella render view, utile se si fa save animation per vedere l'ordine
    - GenerateSurfaceNormals -> generates the normal vector to a surface 
    - IntegrateVariables -> computes the integral of every possible variable
    
- Comparing two files
    - open to files
    - AppendAttributes -> filter to compare variables of the two files (the files must have the same mesh). Select
                          the two files and apply the filter.
                          Very useful, now for ex we can use the calculator filter to subtract quantities from the 
                          different solutions and so on

- 2D plots
    - PlotOverLine -> filter that plots over a line that can be put where we want
    - PlotSelectionOverTime -> plot a selected point over time
    - Plots can be exported as csv

- Export the visualization
    - File -> save screenshot (recommended transparent background option)
    - File -> save animation (takes a screenshot for each timeframe so usually save it into a dedicated directory)
    - File -> save state (save the state-> file opened, filters, etc.) (can also be used to apply the same filters to different file)
